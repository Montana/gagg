The idea in itself is not mine, it is Mazzy McDaid's I'm redoing JS, some HTML, inserting some ReactJS and unwordpressing her website. The idea again is not mine, this is Mazzy the owner/creator of Gagg pictured below.

# gagg
The objective of this project is "unwordpressing" of the site gagg.us - this GithHub repo is (as most are) is for version control, essentially is to save progress. Code written by Montana Mendy.

First we can use https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/, this converts a WP site into a static HTML website. Which makes for easier editing for someone who knows HTML, CSS , JS. You could also run 

<pre>wget -mkEpnp http://gagg.us</pre> 

To get every single file on Gagg and replace it with the work I have done via React, Shift, etc. 

The theme in question here is http://www.mojomarketplace.com/item/fusion-magazine-wordpress-theme, you can see the edited version at www.gagg.us.

I might replace some of the outstanding JS with ShiftJS -- depending on what problems I run into. I doubt this will need to be done though.
