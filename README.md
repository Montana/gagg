Mazzy's "unwordpressing" of her site gagg.us - this GithHub repo is (as most are) is for version control, essentially is to save progress. Code written by Montana Mendy.

First we can use https://wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/, this converts a WP site into a static HTML website. Which makes for easier editing for someone who knows HTML, CSS , JS. 

The theme in question here is http://www.mojomarketplace.com/item/fusion-magazine-wordpress-theme, you can see the edited version at www.gagg.us.

I might replace some of the outstanding JS with ShiftJS -- depending on what problems I run into. I doubt this will need to be done though.
